# PHOTO-VUER
## Built by 
[David Engel](https://github.com/David5280) 
## Summary
Photo-Vuer is a simple application where the user can search for various photos, provided by the [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/developers).  

This is my first application built with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.  Up until now, all my apps have been built in vanilla javascript, jQuery, React, or React Native.  Photo-Vuer was built in two days (not including the time it took to research Vue.js).

## Learning Goals
1)  Learn the basics of Vue.js by myself, with no assistance from the school or my peers
2)  Create a working app in a new framework within the alloted amount of time
3)  Properly utilize the Unsplash API 


## Set-up

You can visit this application [here](https://photo-vuer.herokuapp.com/) on heroku, or:

1) clone this repo<br />
2) run npm install<br />
3) sign up for unsplash api key [here](https://unsplash.com/developers)<br />
4) create a .env file in the root directory
5) write ```VUE_APP_API_KEY=<your api key>``` in the .env file
6) run ```npm run serve``` to open the app locally
